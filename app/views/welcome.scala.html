        <h1>What is Delphi?</h1>

        <p>
            Delphi is a platform to retrieve meta-information on JVM-bytecode based projects.
        </p>


        <h2>What can Delphi do for you?</h2>

        <p>
            You can either query a complete set of information for a specific project or you can retrieve a list of
            matching projects based on specific metrics.
        </p>
